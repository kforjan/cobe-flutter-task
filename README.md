## Setup

  1. Clone the project by using the following link:
  ```
  https://github.com/kforjan/cobe-flutter-task.git
  ```

  2. Get a Bearer token [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

  3. Navigate to the root directory of the project and execute the following commands:
  ```
  flutter pub get
  flutter run --dart-define=ENV=prod --dart-define=TOKEN={YOUR_TOKEN}
  ```
  Note: Replace **{YOUR_TOKEN}** in the second command with the Bearer token obtained from TMDB. For the *ENV* variable, you may choose either **prod** or **dev**. Both will yield the same results, but are provided here for demonstration purposes.
